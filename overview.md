### Narrative Prologue & Customization: 

The game begins with a short introductory story presented via text, followed by static image scenes with subtle camera panning that depict a mythic battle — context may vary depending on the chosen path.
Once the intro ends, the player proceeds to character customization, where they can choose their character’s appearance. This takes place in a square dialogue interface with customization options.

Suddenly, a blackout scene signals that the battle and customization were all part of a dream — a cinematic transition fades the player into reality.
