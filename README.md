### Bathala Adventures

A myth-inspired survival RPG where emotions shape your fate — and the will of the gods decides your path. 

Awaken from a strange dream only to discover the legends are real. In BATHALA, you journey through a dark, folklore-rich world haunted by Philippine mythical creatures like the Aswang and Tikbalang etc... Manage your health, strength, food, and mood as you fight to survive—and ascend. 

You are not just a player. You are a vessel—guided by the unseen will of Bathala, the god who shapes your fate. Your survival depends on understanding his signs, enduring trials, and proving you're worthy of the power you've been entrusted with. 

Customize your character, forge your path, and uncover the truth behind a mysterious ancient book guarded by an all-seeing eye. Armed with only your instincts, a fragile wooden cross, and a sarcastic cat companion, you'll face bosses whose power is tied to the red moon, time of day, and even your own emotional state. 

#### Can you stay strong, keep your spirit intact, and uncover what it truly means to become Bathala?
